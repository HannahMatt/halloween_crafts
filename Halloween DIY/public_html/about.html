<h2>About</h2>

<!-- Included a new sentence at the end so people will come back to our site -->
<p>We are two Simpson College students looking to share ideas on how to decorate for Halloween on a budget. Every Wednesday, we will upload a new halloween craft that is affordable and cute!</p>

<h4>Caitlin Combs</h4>
<p>I am Caitlin, and I enjoy all things Halloween. From pumpkins, to mummies, Halloween is the best holiday of the year! Making crafts for my apartment is something that I enjoy and look forward to doing each and every year!</p>


<!-- Should we include pictures of ourselves here? -->
<h4>Hannah Matt</h4>
<p>I am Hannah, and I love crafting. Because of being a college student, it is hard to make crafts that are not expensive, but our website will show you just what to do!</p>
