<h2>About</h2>
<p>We are two Simpson College students looking to share ideas on how to decorate for Halloween on a budget. All of our crafts are affordable and cute!</p>
<p>I am Caitlin, and I enjoy all things Halloween. From pumpkins, to mummies, Halloween is the best holiday of the year! Making crafts for my apartment is something that I enjoy and look forward to doing each and ever year!</p>
<p>I am Hannah, and I love crafting. Being a college student it is hard to make cratfs that are not expensive, but our website will show you just what to do!</p>
